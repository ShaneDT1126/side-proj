                        Marsha Fonteneau is an ethical assistant prosecuting attorney practicing in a New Jersey town. 
                        Hesitant to launch a search for Mr. Right, Marsha stays busy juggling client files, 
                        immersing herself in her work, and standing on the sidelines observing the love lives of her two 
                        close friends, Tonya Mitchell and Stephanie Dixon.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Marsha’s best friend, Tonya, is a human resources manager who has been married to a handsome basketball 
                        coach for several years. Although she is devoted to her husband, Tonya cannot help but reminisce about 
                        her old flame, Duane Reed. Close pal, Stephanie, is an IT professional who has always sought love. Despite 
                        her best efforts, she still has not been able to commit to a man. Meanwhile, their mutual friend, Romare 
                        Smith, is enjoying all Manhattan has to offer while keeping his lifestyle hidden. As the friends all journey 
                        to find or keep love, their interactions continue to intertwine as secrets are revealed and life experiences 
                        are altered.

                        Love Can Be Eternal is a story about strength, encouragement, and resilience in difficult times as

                        The narrative to each chapter is a backdrop for the chapter that follows. The tone is suggestively being set for the reader. Interpretation of the narrative, to each chapter, belongs solely to the reader.

                        The author does not condone violence and believes parties involved in a dispute should mediate their differences through communication. When communication fails then both parties should work towards reaching an amicable resolution.

                        One may think you have heard or seen it all and then your eyes and ears are awakened to a new reality.

                      <p>
                        Marsha Fonteneau’s day was turning out to be busy and challenging. Marsha had gone to law school and graduated from Seton Hall University in New Jersey. In the past two years she held the position of assistant prosecuting attorney, in a town located, in the north central area of New Jersey.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Most of the cases she handled were drug offenses, white collar fraud, robberies, and petty and grand larceny. Marsha had grown up in north central New Jersey. She often recognized a name, when a new case was listed, on the upcoming docket of cases.
                      </p>
                      <p>Marsha sat at her desk perusing through several case files. She and another assistant prosecutor named Todd Jones were due in court at 1PM for a pre-trial hearing for Duane Reed. The preliminary hearing or pre-trial examination was to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial. Marsha set aside the other case files and glanced through Duane Reed’s file. Marsha sat at her desk reflecting on what she knew about the defendant. Duane Reed had dated her best friend, Tonya Porter. Tonya did not have any siblings. Tonya had dated Duane Reed, while in high school. Her friend Tonya had stopped dating Duane Reed shortly after going away to college in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
                      <p>Duane Reed was a star football player at Teaneck Central High School. Teaneck, New Jersey is a town located in Bergen County, New Jersey. Marsha was well aware that Bergen County is considered a very affluent county in New Jersey. She viewed Teaneck, New Jersey as a mixture of working- class citizens and old money. Marsha had grown up in Teaneck, New Jersey and after high school her parent’s had moved their family to Alpine, New Jersey.</p>
                      <p>Duane Reed was of medium height, well built, athletic and well groomed. Women always noticed and commented on his good looks. Duane Reed’s mother was a local high school teacher. Duane’s mother had been married to Duane’s father but, she divorced him when Duane was around six years old. The sole stable male figure in Duane’s life is an Uncle on his mother’s side of the family named Barry Strong. Duane was an only child. He had been spoiled by his mother as Duane was her only child and son. Marsha thought about mother and children family dynamics. Marsha felt mother’s often put a premium on providing more affection and attention to a son. In a multiple sibling family a daughter often gets short changed. The son gets short changed too, because more attention has been placed on the male in the family. Marsha believed this can skew a man’s sense of emotional balance and make it difficult when they relate to other women that enter their lives.</p>
                      <p>Marsha knew her best friend Tonya met Duane, while she was a cheerleader for a local high school. Their other close friend named Stephanie Dixon and Tonya Porter were cheerleaders in high school. Cheerleading squad participation helped to bond Tonya and Stephanie’s friendship. Tonya and Stephanie were both on the track team. Marsha was on the track team and the school pep squad. Marsha, Tonya, and Stephanie enjoyed attending school games, and keeping the football or basketball teams, spirit ramped up in order to win games.</p>
                      <p>Marsha’s mind took a stroll down memory lane and went back in time to seeing her best friend Tonya and Duane Reed holding hands and sneaking a few kisses in the back of the bus immediately after a football game was over between two rival teams in high school.</p>
                      <p>There was a delay before the bus driver would pull off to take the football players back home. All of the football players, had to be accounted for, before the bus driver would leave. The girls would sit on the bus and make sure they jumped off before the bus driver headed back to Teaneck, New Jersey. Marsha reminisced on how the trio of friends spent so much of their time together. The trio of friends were Tonya Porter, Marsha Fonteneau, and Stephanie Dixon. Marsha would secretly envy her friend Tonya for dating such an athletic, good looking, and well respected young man.</p>

                        Friendships are important. Friendships thrive when boundaries are set and mutual respect is given by each friend as a confirmed given. Even if a mistake is made and a boundary line is crossed a true friend knows how to file it away as a learning point that will make the friendship grow even stronger. A line of demarcation is crossed when a friend has an affair with a mate of the other friend. Friendships are tested when this line of demarcation is crossed. Even if the friends remain friends there is a breach of trust. True stories exist where relatives have married the spouse of the other relative. Excluding instances when a sibling dies and a remarriage occurs to a living sibling. In this case the spouse was previously married to one sibling and after a separation and a divorce the person married the other sibling. All parties were still living at the time of the new marriage to the other sibling. There was undoubtedly a delay in the divorced sibling learning about the new marriage. In this case, there is a definite line that had been crossed, which can make the relatives keep their distance, and go their separate ways. One must recognize it is not right to judge. The only time a perceived breach can be judged is within a court of law or by God.

                        Tonya had distanced herself from Duane and had gone away to college in Atlanta, Georgia. Her decision to go to school out of state was influenced by the knowledge of Duane’s drug dealing. However, she still had feelings for Duane. Tonya enjoyed wearing a short sporty hair style. She had worn her hair shoulder length for many years and had decided to cut her hair. Men and women complimented her on her hair style. She was petite and very attractive. One week-end in her sophomore year Tonya had come back home unexpectedly. She did not call Duane and decided to surprise him by driving over to his apartment in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Tonya was the one that was surprised. While Tonya was parked out in front of the apartment building waiting for Duane to come home she saw Duane’s car pull up and in the passenger seat there was her friend Stephanie. Tonya jumped out of her car and began to yell at Duane, for being such a “low down dirty sneaking” rattlesnake, who would have the nerve to mess around with her friend Stephanie. Tonya yelled, “Duane, couldn’t you have found some other female to mess around with than one that knows me?” Duane glared at Tonya. Stephanie had a shocked look on her face and started crying. Tonya shouted out to Stephanie, “Don’t cry now, you knew what you were doing all along. As long as it stayed hidden in the dark you sure were not thinking about my feelings, Ho!” Duane shouted to Tonya, “Back off.” He saw Tonya jump out of her car. Duane hurried up and escorted Stephanie into the apartment building. The door man had exited the foyer and stood there making sure Tonya did not try to enter the building.

            <p> Born in <b>Michigan</b>, Johnson built a fascinating educational foundation before venturing into the literary world. She first earned a <i>Pre-Law degree</i> from <b>Michigan State University</b>, then went on to obtain an <i>MBA in Finance</i> from <b>Clark Atlanta University</b>. This unique combination of legal and business expertise has enriched her professional journey, allowing her to work across both public and private sectors. </p> 
            <p> Johnson made her literary debut with <i>"Love Can Be Eternal,"</i> a novel that has captured readers' attention with its compelling exploration of human emotions and relationships. The book weaves together themes of <b>love</b>, <b>loss</b>, <b>resilience</b>, and the intricate complexities of friendships. Her storytelling has been particularly praised for its authentic portrayal of personal journeys and emotional depth. </p> 
            <p> When she's not writing, Johnson indulges her creative side through music. She's an <i>accomplished pianist</i>, and her love for music serves as another outlet for her artistic expression. This musical inclination adds another layer to her creative persona, perhaps influencing the rhythm and flow of her prose. What makes Johnson's writing particularly interesting is how she potentially draws from her varied life experiences—from her legal background to her business acumen—to create rich, multifaceted narratives. Her debut novel suggests a promising literary career ahead, as she continues to explore the depths of human connections and emotions through her writing. </p> 
            <p> Given the relatively recent emergence of Johnson as an author, I want to note that while I've aimed to be accurate, it would be worth keeping an eye on her future works to see how her literary journey unfolds. </p>
